                <p class="py-8 text-sm md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">With numerous things crammed onto each page and a lot of little writing, the website appears crowded and challenging to navigate. Customers may find it challenging to quickly browse the site for the information they need due to the small font sizes and inconsistent font sizes used. In addition, there is no obvious information hierarchy or visual cues to direct consumers to important content or goods. Due to unclear navigation and arranging, users who can't find what they're seeking could feel frustrated.</p>

            <div class="bg-BlueGray text-Mimosa rounded-3xl text-justify p-2 md:p-8">

                <div class="grid grid-cols-1 bg-NavyBlue rounded-3xl text-center text-BlueGray text-sm md:text-2xl lg:text-4xl p-11 sm:p-8">Content</div>

                <p class="py-8 text-sm md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">A wide variety of products are shown on the website in several categories. However, product descriptions are typically brief and devoid of information, which makes it challenging for users to make wise purchasing decisions. Additionally, I've observed that some product images have poor quality or resolution, which can hurt the user experience as a whole and make it challenging for users to see the aspects of the product they're interested in.</p>

                <p class="py-8 text-sm md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">I observed that the website displays its products and categories using a grid layout. The grid arrangement seems to be built on a three-column design, with many rows of products in each column. But this website's grid layout isn't always reliable. Additionally, the product photos in the grid arrangement are not always the same size, which might give the entire design an imbalanced appearance and feel.</p>
